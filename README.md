# cicean-kidx-demo Stack starter-pack

Looked through the [Rasa NLU](http://rasa.com/docs/nlu/) and [Rasa Core](http://rasa.com/docs/core/) documentation and ready to build your first intelligent assistant? We have some resources to help you get started! This repository contains the foundations of your first custom assistant.  

This chinese demo comes with a small amount of training data which lets you build a simple assistant. **You can find more training data here in the [forum](https://forum.rasa.com/t/grab-the-nlu-training-dataset-and-starter-packs/903) and use it to teach your assistant new skills and make it more engaging.**

We would recommend downloading this before getting started, although the tutorial will also work with just the data in this repo. 

The initial version of this starter-pack lets you build a simple assistant capable of cheering you up with Chuck Norris jokes.

## Create docker image:

```
$ sudo docker build -f Dockerfile . -t cicean/cicean-kidx-demo:test
```


## Start your docker container

If you haven’t installed Rasa NLU and Rasa Core yet, you can do it by navigating to the project directory and running:  
```
sudo docker run -p 5001:5001 -p 5005:5005 --volume="/home/kidx/Documents/ciceanwang/cicean-kidx-demo/chinese-test":/demo -it cicean/cicean-kidx-demo:test bash
```



## What’s in this starter-pack?

This starter-pack contains some training data and the main files which you can use as the basis of your first custom assistant. It also has the usual file structure of the assistant built with Rasa Stack. This starter-pack consists of the following files:

This will train the Rasa NLU model and store it inside the `/models/current/nlu` folder of your project directory.

2. Train the Rasa Core model by running:  
```make train-core```  
This will train the Rasa Core model and store it inside the `/models/current/dialogue` folder of your project directory.

3. In a new terminal start the server for the custom action by running:
